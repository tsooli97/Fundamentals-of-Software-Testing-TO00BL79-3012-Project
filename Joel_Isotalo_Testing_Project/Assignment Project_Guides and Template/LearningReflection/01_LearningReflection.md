> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
- 
    The testing experience was overall very fun and practical. Addtitionally, the provided templates were helpful in guiding the assingment flow. 

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.
- 
    I wrote the test cases by using the provided example ideas, as well as by observing the page contents and functionality to determine what test cases could be relevant for the test suites. 

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management. 
 -     
    -

## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
- 
    I used Visual Studio Code for this project

     
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
-
    I didn't encounter any major challenges, the assignment and instructions were quite clear and straightforward.

## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?
-
    I did not have any trouble with GitHub. I've used it extensively before for both Laurea and personal projects in many different programming languages.
      

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
- 
    I think I would at the very least use Selenium for test automation. Python programming familiar to me and I've used Selenium in the past for creating some automated workflows. 

## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing
- 
    I searched on the employment website Indeed.com using the terms 'Tester' and 'Automation Tester'. Some of the most in-demand skills and competencies were:
    - Experience with manual software testing
    - Experience with automated testing frameworks (Selenium, Robot Framework etc.)
    - Experience in Agile software development approaches
    - Familiarity with Jira and Zephyr
    - Analytical skills and mindset


## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?
- 
    If I were to continue with a career in software testing, there's a few key areas that I would need to fill gaps in. In the current job market, I would likely have to a stronger hobby background in both software development projects and doing e.g. unit, integration and automated testing of my own software. In addition, I feel that I should get more familiar with the automated testing frameworks due to their large prevelance in the current QA testing work landscape. Finally, while e.g. Jira is already familiar to me from work, I think that I should try to get some practical experience with the Zephyr testing solution too. 



## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 
-
    In my opinion, this project was quite effective in connecting the course theory with practical application. It allowed me to apply the various concepts from the book material and Percipio 'Software Testing Foundation' video course in a meaningful real world setting, which was helpful in bettering my understanding of planning test cases and reporting bugs. 

    I've personally found the course's learning style to be quite flexibile and effective (independent learning effort and pace). It has integrated well alongside my other studies and work schedule. Overall, this course has been very interesting and really helped me improve my understanding of what software testing truly involves and is about.
